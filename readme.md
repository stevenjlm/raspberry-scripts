# Scripts for Rasberry Pi

## Cycle Alert

Contains a script to continuously query the Nation Weather Service API to see if the forcast contains the words "rain", "showers", etc. and that the winds are below a certain threshold. An LED will power on to alert the user that they should check the weather before cycling. More info in the directory README.md file.
